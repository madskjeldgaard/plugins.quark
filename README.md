This is a simple package management system for installing SuperCollider plugins. It automatically downloads, compiles and installs UGens on your system. It contains a directory of plugins and an easy to use GUI inspired by the Quark system.

## Installation

```supercollider
Quarks.install("https://github.com/madskjeldgaard/plugins.quark")
```

## Usage

```supercollider
// Open the gui to install packages.
Plugins.gui;
```

See the helpfile for "Plugins" for more information on usage.

## Development

This project is still a work in progress - but please, help out if you can. I am particularly grateful for pull requests that fixes things, but also issues. Thanks.
